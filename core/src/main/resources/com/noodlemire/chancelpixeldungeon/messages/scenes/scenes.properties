scenes.interlevelscene.file_not_found=Save file not found. If this error persists after restarting, it may mean this save game is corrupted. Sorry about that.
scenes.interlevelscene.io_error=Cannot read save file. If this error persists after restarting, it may mean this save game is corrupted. Sorry about that.
scenes.interlevelscene.continue=Touch to continue.

scenes.interlevelscene.tip_1=Treat every fight like a puzzle. Creativity is key.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_2=If no wraith comes from a bone pile, it did not contain any cursed items.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_3=Keep in mind the kinds of items you have. They are there to help.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_4=If a mob's armor is giving you trouble, try switching to a slower weapon.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_5=Don't worry about "wasting" consumables on mobs. They won't respawn once you've killed enough.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_6=Invisibility will never be disrupted by reading a scroll or drinking a potion, but it will be dispelled by shouting a scroll or throwing a potion.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_7=Upgrading your starting weapon can help more than you'd expect, and you will get plenty more scrolls of upgrade later.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_8=An attack will always become a critical hit if your combat stamina is at max.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_9=Don't forget to check the Adventurer's Guide!
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_10=When examining a mob, you can see a number by its name. This indicates its level and EXP reward.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_11=Your defense is also your offense. The more hits you can safely take, the easier it is to replenish your combat stamina mid-fight.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_12=Try not to rely on pits to kill enemies too much, as fallen enemies only give half EXP.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_13=Swarms of flies only ever drop potions of health as loot.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_14=Red is 100%. Orange is 75%. Yellow is 50%. White is 25%. Absense is 0%. That is what you can see from the Dynamic Strength Indicator and the way your character flashes when waiting. Most importantly: Red is a crit.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_15=Stones of Binding can also be used to check if an item is cursed or not.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_16=If you want another place to discuss Chancel Pixel Dungeon, a Discord link is in the About page from the Title Screen.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_17=Don't be too over-eager to give yourself strength or misc slots on level up. Your health is important, as you will likely take damage frequently.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_18=The kind of potion that a seed can be brewed into will change if its immediate preference does not exist in that run.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_19=Potions of health, levitation, invisibility, and hydrocombustion exist in every game. Any other potion might or might not exist.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_20=Scrolls of upgrade, blessing, identify, and cleansing exist in every game. Any other scroll might or might not exist.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_21=Don't like the subclass you chose? You might find a well of exchange that you can drink from to swap to the other subclass.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_22=As long as a fire is kept burning, flammable terrain will never burn down into embers.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_23=Electricity will recharge wands upon direct contact.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_24=Frozen meat is better for your health than cooked meat.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_25=If you only have scrolls of upgrade identified, you can throw unidentified scrolls into a well of exchange until one turns into one. The scroll you threw will be a scroll of blessing. This also works in reverse.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_26=If you know a mob is coming your way, you should trap the doorway with a harmful seed.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_27=A scroll of blessing can always be turned into three stones of augmentation at an alchemy pot. Keep this in mind if your weapon is too fast or too slow for your liking.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_28=Seeds and traps can affect flying creatures above them if you throw an item on the trap or plant to trigger it.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_29=Be careful of the fourth floor of each region. It always contains a single extra strong enemy, which may be an empowered version of a previous enemy, or something from the next region.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_30=The next shop is always more expensive than the previous one. If you can, do your shopping in the earliest floor possible.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_31=Bombs are a fun way to reveal mimics, and only put the chest itself at risk. Any contained items will be safe, no matter what.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_32=Potions of Telepathy can extend certain sight-based effects to every mob on the floor, though some are weakened if walls are in the way.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_33=A potion of levitation combined with a potion of haste can let you fly a distance that would've otherwise required three potions of levitation.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_34=Flying above a pit or in the middle of some traps can be a good way to keep melee enemies from reaching you.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_35=If no mobs are around you for at least 5 turns in a row, your combat stamina will automatically replenish itself completely for your convenience.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_36=Remember that you can examine anyting in the level. Use it if you see anything unfamiliar.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_37=Floor tiles with grass, embers, or other decorative details on them cannot have hidden traps. This applies to hidden doors in walls as well.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_38=Mobs will only willingly walk into a harmful gas if they're already in it, they're very close to reaching their target, or the gas is mixed with enticement gas.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_39=If you can't find a key to a locked room, you might be able to find a way in from the floor above, without using the key.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_40=There is no seed that will ever prefer to brew potions of experience. You can only brew or find one through sheer luck.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_41=Distance is the strongest tool you have, even if you're a melee user. It offers you the greatest range of opportunities to deal with dangerous situations in a favorable way, so always consider your options before letting enemies get close to you.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_42=Enticement gas's ability to lure mobs depends on its concentration. If there's only a little, you won't immediately have to worry about the whole floor coming to ambush you.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_43=If you have two of the same unidentified potion or scroll, it's usually best to use one. One identified consumable is more likely to help you later than two unidentified ones.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_44=Some effects are more powerful in deeper levels of the dungeon, especially when it comes to consumables that deal damage. Keep this in mind if there's an effect that initially seems too weak to even kill a rat.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_45=Missile weapons are automatically too high quality to break if their maximum durability would exceed 100.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_46=The hidden downside to blessing ankhs is that a blessed ankh will only revive you with partial health. A regular ankh will restore you to full health, in addition to letting you use the dew vial to heal yourself more.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_47=Wands always spawn with 2 charges, regardless of level. Using up all their charges immediately is not a way to instantly know their level.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_48=It may be okay to use strong equipment that requires one more point of strength than you currently have. Despite penalties, it can still be stronger than a weaker item that you can use properly.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_49=Your Maximum Dynamic Strength (MDS) increases with each level up. This means that each level up will let you either attack more often before needing to replenish combat stamina, or wait less often between maximum damage attacks.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_50=Upgraded items are immune to explosions. If you don't mind risking a pile of unidentified equipment you wouldn't otherwise use, you can bomb it so only upgraded stuff remains.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_51=Enchantments and glyphs can never be removed by scrolls of upgrade if the item is at level 0. However, upgrading a weapon or armor that is at +1 or above will risk it.
scenes.interlevelscene.tip_52=You won't be shown the same tip twice in a row, unless you have already seen them all, or you close and reopen the game.

scenes.introscene.text=Many heroes have ventured into the dungeon before you from the city above. Some have returned with treasures and magical artifacts, most have never been heard from again.\n\nNone, however, have ventured to the bottom and retrieved the Amulet of Yendor, which is said to be guarded by an ancient evil in the depths. Even now dark energy radiates from below, making its way up into the city.\n\nYou consider yourself ready for the challenge. Most importantly, you feel that fortune smiles upon you. It's time to start your own adventure!
